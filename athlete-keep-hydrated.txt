Sweat helps the body to maintain optimal body temperature:
   Sweating is the body’s primary way of maintaining optimal body temperature. Consuming liquids replenishes the fluids lost during exercise.



involved in muscle contractions
    Restoring fluids maintains normal muscle function, helps prevent a decrease in physical performance 



!
People experience dehydration when they lose 2% of their body mass loss (BML) in fluids/water/sweat:

A loss of sweat equal to 2% of body weight causes a noticeable decrease of physical and mental performance.  
moderately dehydrated (2.5% of body weight) and critically dehydrated (5% of body weight).



Losses of 5% or more of body weight during physical activities may decrease the capacity for work by roughly 30%

All eight subjects were able to complete 140 minutes walking when euhydrated and 3% dehydrated. Seven subjects completed the walk when 5% dehydrated, but when dehydrated by 7%, six subjects stopped walking after an average of only 64 minutes.

stay away from sugar-sweetened beverages when trying to stay hydrated


"conditioned to expect high levels of sweetness in everything…. You might say we are malhydrated, because we drink so much soda and fruit juice and other sugar-sweetened beverages, and by that I mean we drink beverages that harm our health. Even energy drinks and vitamin waters, most are loaded with sugar and not worth the use."Walter Willett
If you don't like pure water, you can take water flavored with fruit or vegetables (lemons, berries, or orange or cucumber slices), coffee or tea.

PIERRE




Pierre, 35 years old, marketing executive, originally from Lyon, France, now living in Lisbon, Portugal

Run

What sports do you practice?
I'm a versatile athlete, combining elements from various sports. I regularly engage in running, cycling, and swimming. Running is my core focus, and I've recently incorporated some muscle-building exercises into my routine.

How often do you run?
I aim to run at least four times a week, incorporating both short sprints and long-distance sessions. It provides a good balance for my overall fitness and mental well-being.

When was the last time you went out for a run?
Just yesterday, covering a scenic route along the coast of Lisbon. The sea breeze adds a refreshing touch to my runs.

Races

What was the last race you ran?
My most recent race was a half-marathon last month, taking advantage of the picturesque views in Lisbon. The experience was both challenging and invigorating.

How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
I had trained meticulously for the race, focusing on pacing and hydration. Unlike past experiences, I managed to avoid the fatigue that haunted me during my first marathon attempt. Crossing the finish line was a triumph, with the backdrop of the cityscape providing an extra layer of satisfaction.

What would you have done differently? Why?
Looking back, I would have paid more attention to my pre-race nutrition. Ensuring a balance between energy intake and hydration is crucial for optimal performance.

Hydration

What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
Hydration is a key aspect of my routine. I carry a hydration belt with me, making sure to sip water regularly during my runs. It prevents the issues I faced during my early days of running when I neglected proper hydration.

Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
In the past, I underestimated the importance of staying hydrated, leading to cramps and fatigue. Those experiences taught me the value of consistent water intake, especially during longer runs.

What would you never do again? Why?
I'll never compromise on hydration. Forgetting my water bottle during a run is a mistake I won't repeat, as it directly affects my performance and recovery.

Training

How do you structure your training sessions?
I follow a well-rounded training plan, incorporating interval training, long runs, and strength sessions. My focus is not only on improving my running speed and endurance but also on overall fitness and injury prevention.

What motivates you to keep running?
The sense of freedom and accomplishment that running brings is unmatched. It allows me to clear my mind, set new goals, and stay physically active. Plus, the running community in Lisbon is fantastic, providing a supportive network that keeps me motivated.


Pierre: Beyond the first marathon.
